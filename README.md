# RoboTech
Official deposit 2021-2022 of the Robotech Nancy team for the Coupe de France de Robotique project

After many years of exploring the four corners of the world and the universe, our friends the robots have

decided to explore their past. In 2022, the robots will search the ruins of an ancient robotic civilization in search of forgotten fragments of their origins.

Excavation square, buried treasures and sacred statuettes, this is what awaits our experienced archaeologists, and nothing will stop them in the quest for their History. So take out the shovels and pickaxes, because adventure awaits us!

Devise :
*The optimal use of energy is an elementary basis in all our designs. Knowing how to optimize the use of existing robots does not satisfy us. We want to learn how to design the robots of tomorrow using innovative technologies as well as real intelligence supported by high-level electronics and computing.*

Our goals this year are:

- Build the 2 necessary robots in the 2022 version of the competition.
- Consolidate the structuring into independent functional blocks (rolling base, Odometry, specific annual robotics part, Introduction of maintenance services, etc.).
- Make computer codes of a very high level of quality (Methodological, Reliable (dealing with all errors), real professional documentation, ...).
- This year we want to introduce graphs and graph engine in order to make it easier and reliable to evolve the competition both for this year and especially in the years to come.
- Introduce the use of WEB technologies in Human Robot Interface software.
- Consolidate wireless communications between our two collaborative robots to introduce immunity to cyber-security attacks.
